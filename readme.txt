# Auto-Battle RPG Game
This is a simple turn based RPG game, it was developed as a test for Kokku.

## Platforms Used
- IntelliJ Rider (2022.1.1)

## Documentation
The project already had a few of the procedures and business logics already implemented, here goes a little bit of what I did to improve it:

### Setup
Here I will document the changes I've made before actually coding anything in particular.
1. Changed the indentation from spaces to tabs;
	The project was small enough and it was early in the stages of its implementation, so it wasn't a big change.
2. Applied a code style of my own choice;

### Code
This is a description of which code-related changes I think are important to talk about.
